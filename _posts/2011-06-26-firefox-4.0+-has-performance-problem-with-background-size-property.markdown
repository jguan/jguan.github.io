title: Firefox 4.0+ has performance problem with background-size property

Firefox starts supporting standard `background-size` property since 4.0. 
But unfortunately, it likely doesn't render this property properly. If you are 
using Firefox 4.0+ or Chrome, you might have noticed the angled striped background 
on my site. The current `background-size` is:
{% highlight css %}
body {
	...
	background-size: 100px 100px;
	...
}
{% endhighlight %}
If you change it to a smaller size with firebug or other tools on your browser, 
you would see the stripes get thinner. It works perfect on Chrome but **DON'T 
do it on Firefox 4.0+**, as if so it would cause Firefox hanging forever. I 
guess the algorithm Firefox is using to render `background-size` needs to be 
optimised for small size.
 
I found this problem because my ideal effect of my site is to use very thin stripes 
as background. If you are brave, try this beautiful but dangerous change on my site.
{% highlight css %}
body {
 ...
 background-size: 5px 5px;
 ...
}
{% endhighlight %}
