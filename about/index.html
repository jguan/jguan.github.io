	<header><h2 class="title">Who is Jeremy?</h2></header>

	<p>I'm an all round web developer from Sydney, Australia with five years industry experience. I've been involved in a wide range of projects with my professional 
	front end and back end skills and always delivered excellent service and high quality web development at minimal expense.</p>

	<h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
	<p>I was born and grew up in Zhengzhou, Henan province of China. I quickly became interested in computing and the Internet when my parents bought me a 
	"Pentium 166" back in 1997. Soon after, I started learning basic web development knowledge (HTML/CSS/ASP) and ran my personal websites until I graduated from 
	Zhengzhou University. In the mean time, I realised I finally find the career I love so much. In 2001, I began my IT career from 
	<a href="http://www.mydrivers.com" target="_blank">mydrivers.com</a>. In order to enlarge my vision and improve my technical level, I continued my study in 
	University of Wollongong, Australia in 2003. Two years later, I received my Master degree in Computer Studies there. After a short break in China I came back to 
	Australia and joined <a href="http://dbnet.com.au" target="_blank">dbNet</a> in October 2006 as software systems/web application developer, where my skills and 
	experience get boosted.</p>

	<h3>SKILLS</h3>
	<p>Currently, I am primarily using Perl/Catalyst as well as jQuery to develop highly usable, visually attractive and standard based web applications for clients 
	in my work. During my spare time I also learn and try other web development technologies, especially Ruby/Rails, Python/Django, HTML5 and CSS3, to keep my skills 
	polished. In fact, as a tireless seeker of knowledge, I'm passionate to all creative and innovative IT tech and always sync myself with the fast changing world.</p>
